* apertium-get

  This is a little script to quickly get an Apertium language pair
  (with its monolingual dependencies) set up for development. It's
  meant for developers and people interested in hacking on the
  language data; if you just want to run the newest translators you
  should use the [[http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Installation][nightly repositories]].

** Usage

   You'll need the newest Apertium development dependencies installed
   first, follow the "Prerequisites" step at
   http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Installation but just skip installing
   any language data in the "Minimal installation from SVN" step â€“
   that's what this script handles.
